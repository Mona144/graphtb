## Dev Environment:

Our dev environment is managed by `poetry`. We provide a `flake.nix` file for NixOS users, if needed. Although there are
some caveats to the current NixOS setup.

We use `black` for code formatting, and `ruff` for general coding style advice. This can be enforced by installing the
pre-commit hooks through `pre-commit install`.
